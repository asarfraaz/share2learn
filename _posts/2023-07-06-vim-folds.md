Often while reading code, we encounter scenarios where we want to get an overview of the code.

Sometimes we are interested in 

- viewing the functions present in the code.
- viewing all classes defined in the code.
- viewing all methods of a class
- or just viewing the outer loop of a nested loop code

Most editors allow you to "collapse" a block of code to view just its definition

We could achieve the same and more using some simple key strokes in Vi


Few scenarios are mentioned in the video -> [![Vim : View function/class definitions](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xGR_0flEV3Q/1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGR_0flEV3Q "Vim : View function/class definitions")



**NOTE** : To make these commands work on Python code you need to set the correct foldmethod as 

```:set foldmethod=indent```

The Vi commands mentioned are as follows :

- ```zM``` : View all definitions in the file ( Toggle all folds )
- ```zo``` : To open one level of fold
- ```zR``` : To open all folds
- ```zM``` : To close all the folds ( Toggle all folds )
