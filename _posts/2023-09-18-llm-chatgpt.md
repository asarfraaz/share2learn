Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained a lot of momentum in recent times with the advent of the "Transformer" architecture. With it came the LLMs and ChatGPT

Often, one wonders what these terminologies are? How are they related to eachother?

Instead of me writing the answer for this, I asked the same question to ChatGPT and got some interesting results.

But first, let's try to take a bird'e eye view of these terms: LLM and ChatGPT

LLM stands for Large Language Model. Its a machine learning model. To be more precise, it's a Deep Learning Neural Network based model that is trained on a very large unstructured textual dataset. Large here usually means 100s of Gigabytes of data. Entire Wikipedia is just one of many datasets that is used to train ( or teach ) an LLM. Hopefully, this should give you a better idea of what is meant by "Large"


In simple terms, an LLM learns various langauge patterns from the enormous amount of data it is trained on. Based on this learning, when an LLM is given a part of a sentence and some context, it can generate the next set of words following the sentence
