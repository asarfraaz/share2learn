Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained a lot of momentum in recent times with the advent of the "Transformer" architecture. With it came the LLMs and ChatGPT

Often, one wonders what these terminologies are? How are they related to eachother?

Instead of me writing the answer for this, I asked the same question to ChatGPT and got some interesting results.

But first, let's try to take a bird'e eye view of these terms: **LLM** and **ChatGPT**

## Terminologies

**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**. It's a machine learning model. To be more precise, it's a Deep Learning Neural Network based model that is trained on a very large unstructured textual dataset. Large here usually means 100s of Gigabytes of data. Entire Wikipedia is just one of many datasets that is used to train ( or teach ) an LLM. Hopefully, this should give you a better idea of what is meant by "Large"


In simple terms, an LLM learns various langauge patterns from the enormous amount of data it is trained on. Based on this learning, when an LLM is given a part of a sentence and some context, it can generate the next set of words following the sentence


**ChatGPT** which stands for **Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer** is an
application that uses a pre-trained LLM built using Transformer architecture
for generating text. It provides a simple chat interface to the users that
helps them have a conversation with the underlying LLM. ChatGPT adds a layer of
history or context above the underlying LLM. This gives the user an impression
that ChatGPT is remembering the previously asked questions. This is fundamental
to having any conversation.


## Fun with ChatGPT

Instead of me writing so much, I thought of asking ChatGPT to write a blog post
explaining about the differences between an LLM and ChatGPT. I got some
interesting and surprising results.

- At first, I got a [very wrong answer](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/wrong-llm.html) !!!
- I then gave it a task to write a blog that would explain the difference between LLM and ChatGPT [in such simple terms that even my grandmother should understand it](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/grandma-llm-chatgpt.html) ( I wanted to check if it understood that I basically was asking for an explanation in layman terms )
- I finally asked it to spice up the blog by making it a [conversation between a grandmother and her grandson](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/convo-llm-chatgpt.html). This was a very interesting read indeed !!! I was amazed by the conversation style that it chose for this. It also gave a summary of the entire conversation at the end that was crisp and to the point !!!
