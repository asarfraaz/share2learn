"How can I portray my skills in my resume?"

This is one question that most Professionals usually ask me about

The ones who ask this question are usually 

- moving from one role to another, or
- from one project to another, 
- or sometimes just completed a Certification Course and want to transition
  into another domain based on their newly acquired skill

Unfortunately for most, this question is asked too late in the cycle. They want
to jump the wagon and now seeking out answers on what to do. My answer is
usually to sit down and go through all the works they have done ( from the
smallest to the mightiest ) and prepare a document mentioning their
"contributions" and the "roles" they played in those tasks. More on this later,
or may be you could [start a
Discussion](https://github.com/asarfraaz/share2learn/discussions) on this and
let me know if you are interested in knowing about this further

In this post, I want to focus on what one should do, as soon as they start
something new. May be its a new company or a new project or a new team that
they have joined. Or may be its a new Course that they have enrolled into.

The simple answer is : **"Write it down"**

The details are in, "What to write" and "Where to write"

## What to write

No day goes by without you learning something you did not already know. Do you
disagree? May be you overlooked those "learning" moments. Become more conscious
of those "learning" moments in your day. Keep looking out for these small
moments in life and work. These are the things that one should write. It could
be something like

- Writing code using a new style
- Designing concept you saw being applied that you were not aware of
- Testing scenario thats new for you
- A automation script you saw someone use to be more productive
- An email that caught your eye, for its form and structure
- A new syntax you learnt about your programming language from a video

When you learn or notice something new, Write down these things in your book

- Narration in your own words about what was "new" for you
- Mention the scenario and context when you saw that somethng "new"
- What did you learn from it?

Sounds a lot? May be. But for someone who cares about himself, it would be fun.

Takes a lot of time? May be you have more time to spend watching the works of
other creators on that "income reducing electronic gadget" in your hand that is
prefixed with the word smart.


# Where to write ?

In a "Book", is the simple answer.

There is something Divine about using a pen and book. It is usually said that
our hand is the extension of our brain. What you write on paper, you will
retain it for a longer period of time.

But then, all this was for presenting it in a resume, right? How can my resume
be connected with the book?

You don't. Every few days, may be, once a week or fortnight, you write a blog
post about your new learnings. All derived from your own personal experience,
distilled from your notes in your personal book. 

How you present this is all upto you. May be you 

- Write blog posts like a series of tutorials for the new concepts you learnt.
- Write a general post about a situation without mentioning any names and share
  your learnings with others who might benefit from it.


## Practical suggestions

1. Always carry a pocket book to write down small notes as soon as you notice your "learning" moment.
2. Allocate time 3 to 4 times a week to write down your "learnings"
3. Target to post atleast 2 to 3 blogs per month

Over a period of a year, you would have written atleast 20 or more blog posts

This blog is what you can mention in your resume. It shows your professional
side with valuable quantitative points to backup your understanding of various
concepts. Proof that you just did not warm the benches at work, but applied
your brain cells to add value to the product you contributed.

Creating a GitHub Repository with your code accomplishments is an added bonus

## What next?

I invite you to use this blog "Share2Learn" as a platform to build your habit
of "creating" content.

  and I shall add you as a collaborator on the [share2learn GitHub
  Repository](https://github.com/asarfraaz/share2learn). 
- You can follow the steps mentioned in [this discussion
  thread](https://github.com/asarfraaz/share2learn/discussions/17) and start
  blogging.
