"How can I portray my skills in my resume?"

This is one question that most Professionals usually ask me about

They are usually moving from one role to another, or from one project to
another, or sometimes just completed a Certification Course like Machine
Learning Course and want to transition into another domain based on their newly
acquired skill

Usually, this question is asked too late in the cycle. They want to jump the
wagon and now seeking at answers on what to do. My answer is usually to sit
down and go through all the works they have done ( from the smallest to the
mightiest ) and prepare a document mentioning their "contributions" and the
"roles" they played in those tasks. More on this later, or may be you could
start a Discussion on this and let me know if you are interested in knowing
about this further

In this post, I want to focus on what one should do, as soon as they start
something new. May be its a new company or a new project or a new team that
they have joined. Or may be its a new Course that they have enrolled into.

The simple answer is : *"Write it down"*

The details are in, "What to write" and "Where to write"

## What to write

No day goes by without you learning something you did not already know. Keep
looking out for these small moments in life and work. These are the things that
one should write. It could be something like

- Writing code using a new style
- Designing concept you saw being applied that you were not aware of
- Testing scenario thats new for you
- A automation script you saw someone use to be more productive
- An email that caught your eye, for its form and structure

Often, one wonders what these terminologies are? How are they related to eachother?

Instead of me writing the answer for this, I asked the same question to ChatGPT and got some interesting results.

But first, let's try to take a bird'e eye view of these terms: **LLM** and **ChatGPT**

## Terminologies

**LLM** stands for **Large Language Model**. It's a machine learning model. To be more precise, it's a Deep Learning Neural Network based model that is trained on a very large unstructured textual dataset. Large here usually means 100s of Gigabytes of data. Entire Wikipedia is just one of many datasets that is used to train ( or teach ) an LLM. Hopefully, this should give you a better idea of what is meant by "Large"


In simple terms, an LLM learns various langauge patterns from the enormous amount of data it is trained on. Based on this learning, when an LLM is given a part of a sentence and some context, it can generate the next set of words following the sentence


**ChatGPT** which stands for **Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer** is an
application that uses a pre-trained LLM built using Transformer architecture
for generating text. It provides a simple chat interface to the users that
helps them have a conversation with the underlying LLM. ChatGPT adds a layer of
history or context above the underlying LLM. This gives the user an impression
that ChatGPT is remembering the previously asked questions. This is fundamental
to having any conversation.


## Fun with ChatGPT

Instead of me writing so much, I thought of asking ChatGPT to write a blog post
explaining about the differences between an LLM and ChatGPT. I got some
interesting and surprising results.

- At first, I got a [very wrong answer](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/wrong-llm.html) !!!
- I then gave it a task to write a blog that would explain the difference between LLM and ChatGPT [in such simple terms that even my grandmother should understand it](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/grandma-llm-chatgpt.html) ( I wanted to check if it understood that I basically was asking for an explanation in layman terms )
- I finally asked it to spice up the blog by making it a [conversation between a grandmother and her grandson](https://asarfraaz.github.io/share2learn/data/convo-llm-chatgpt.html). This was a very interesting read indeed !!! I was amazed by the conversation style that it chose for this. It also gave a summary of the entire conversation at the end that was crisp and to the point !!!
