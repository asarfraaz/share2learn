## Chapter 0 : Preface
- Machines don't learn !!!
- They only come up with a mathematical function that maps a set of inputs
  to a set of outputs
- If input values are from a different distribution than what the machine
  was trained on, then it would not give the right output. This is why it
  is not like the learning that we humans do
