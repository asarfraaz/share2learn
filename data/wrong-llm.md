# Wrong understanding of LLM

I asked the following question to ChatGPT like app created by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com) in their course : [Introduction to ChatGPT](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-chatgpt)

```
What is the difference between LLM and ChapGPT?
```

ChatGPT misunderstood the meaning of LLM as Language Model for Legal Text and gave me this answer

```
LLM (Language Model for Legal Text) and ChapGPT are both language models
developed by OpenAI, but they have different focuses and applications.

1	LLM (Language Model for Legal Text):

    ◦	LLM is specifically designed to understand and generate legal text.
    ◦	It has been trained on a large corpus of legal documents, including
            court cases, statutes, regulations, and legal opinions.
    ◦	LLM can assist with legal research, drafting legal documents, answering
            legal questions, and providing legal advice.
    ◦	It is trained to understand legal concepts, terminology, and the
            structure of legal arguments.

2	ChapGPT:

    ◦	ChapGPT is a variant of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained
            Transformer) language model.
    ◦	It is a more general-purpose language model that can understand and
            generate text across various domains.
    ◦	ChapGPT is trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human
            trainers, and publicly available text from the internet.
    ◦	It can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as drafting emails,
            writing code, answering questions, creating conversational agents,
            and more.
    ◦	Unlike LLM, ChapGPT does not have a specific focus on legal text and
            may not have the same level of expertise in legal concepts and
            terminology.

In summary, LLM is a specialized language model for legal text, while ChapGPT
is a more general-purpose language model that can be applied to various
domains.
```

Though the answer was wrong, I tried playing around with it and asked this new question

```
That was a very long reponse. Can you reduce that by half?
```

And it very obediently gave me this response

```
LLM is a language model specifically designed for legal text, while ChapGPT is
a more general-purpose language model. LLM is trained on legal documents and
can assist with legal research and drafting, while ChapGPT can be used for a
wide range of tasks across different domains.
```

I tried to correct it with this vague prompt, and I was surprised that it understood it !!!

```
LLM is not for legal text. I meant Large Language Models
```

It humbly accepted its mistake and gave me this reponse

```
Apologies for the confusion. LLM stands for "Large Language Models," which
refers to a class of language models developed by OpenAI. These models,
including GPT-3 and subsequent versions, are designed to understand and
generate text across various domains. They can be used for tasks like drafting
emails, writing code, answering questions, and more.
